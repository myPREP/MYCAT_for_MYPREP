Thirty-First (15th Extraordinary) Session
Geneva, September 27 to October 5, 2004
Report on the Policy Advisory Commission (PAC)
Memorandum of the Director General
1 The Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO approved, in their thirty-second series of meetings, from March 25 to 27, 1998, the proposal contained in the 1998-1999 biennial Program and Budget to establish the Policy Advisory Commission (PAC), comprised of eminent individuals from a wide range of policy backgrounds.
It was noted that
“the policy-making and medium-term planning processes of WIPO, its responsiveness to international trends and technological developments, and its capacity to anticipate and to meet the needs of the market sector and users of global protection systems, would benefit considerably from the availability of informed and objective advice from eminent international experts from a broad range of fields with bearing on intellectual property cooperation and WIPO’s operations” (see document A/32/2 - WO/BC/18/2,
Sub-program 01.3).
2 The mandate of this independent advisory body was defined in the same document
(see Sub-program 01.3) and reaffirmed in the most recent Program and Budget of the Organization (see document WO/PBC/7/2, Sub-program 02.2), which states that the PAC will “continue to provide objective and informed external expert advice to the Director General, particularly with respect to policy-making, medium-term planning, processes and the needs in the market sector”.
3 It should be noted that the role of the Policy Advisory Commission is strictly advisory and consultative and shall “never replace or diminish the role of the Member States in the initiation and monitoring of the program of the Organization” (see document A/32/2 - WO/BC/18/2, Sub-program 01.3).
4 The fourth meeting of the PAC took place on November 14, 2003, in Sinaia, Romania.
Twenty members attended the meeting, and its report to the Director General of WIPO is contained in Annex I.
The list of participants at the meeting is contained in Annex II.
5 The General Assembly is invited to note and comment on the present document and the report to the Director General of WIPO.
